Google Homepage Clone

This is my first real project where I've had to "build" something from scratch. I had to deconstruct Google's homepage and rebuild it. The goal of the project was to get myself to start thinking about how elements get placed and how to style and align them. This project took me longer than I thought and it also helped me realize I didn't know as much about HTML and CSS as I thought.
